## [0.5.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (Aug 1, 2013)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - To align with Vagrant's core behaviour, forwarded ports are no longer attached
    to 127.0.0.1 and `redir`'s `--laddr` parameter is skipped in case the `:host_ip`
    config is not provided, that means `redir` will listen on connections coming
    from any of the host's IPs.

FEATURES:

  - Add support for salt-minion and add latest dev release for ubuntu codenamed saucy [#116](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/pull/116)

  - Properly handle forwarded port collisions [#5](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/5)
  - Container's customizations are now written to the config file (usually
    kept under `/var/lib/lxc/CONTAINER/config`) instead of passed in as a `-s`
    parameter to `lxc-start`

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/compare/v0.3.4...v0.4.0) (Jul 18, 2013)

  - Remove `/tmp` files after the machine has been successfully shut down [#68](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/68)
  - Clean up base boxes files after they've been configured, resulting in smaller packages

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  - Boxes `lxc-template` should support a `--tarball` parameter
  - `start_opts` config was renamed to `customize`, please check the README for the expected parameters
  - V1 boxes are no longer supported
  - `target_rootfs_path` is no longer supported, just symlink `/var/lib/lxc` to the desired folder in case you want to point it to another partition
